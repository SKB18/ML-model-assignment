Feature selection is a critical step in machine learning to identify the most relevant features that contribute to the predictive power of the model. In the given code, two feature selection techniques are applied: chi-squared test (chi2) for categorical features and SelectKBest for selecting top K features.

Chi-squared test for Categorical Features:

Categorical variables are encoded using methods like ordinal encoding or binary encoding to convert them into numerical representations.
The chi2 scoring function is used to measure the dependency between categorical features and the target variable.
The chi-squared test calculates the statistical significance of the relationship between categorical variables by comparing observed and expected frequencies.
The SelectKBest method is used to select the top K features based on their chi-squared scores.
SelectKBest for Selecting Top K Features:

After encoding categorical variables and scaling numerical variables, the SelectKBest feature selection method is applied.
SelectKBest is a univariate feature selection method that selects the best features based on univariate statistical tests.
In this code, the chi2 score function is used with SelectKBest to select the top K features.
The k parameter in SelectKBest determines the number of top features to be selected.
